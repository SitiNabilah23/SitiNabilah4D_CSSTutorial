<p> “Have the courage to walk away from the drama & people who create it around you. It’s most often about them & not you. Surround yourself with those who support you & believe in you. Focus on the positive. Love those who treat you well, pray for the ones who don’t! They need it!” by Mufti Ismael Menk. And fill your heart with Imaan and it will become the most peaceful place on the earth.</p>
